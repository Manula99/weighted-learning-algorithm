A known number of bots are lost in a weighted graph. The goal is to locate and return the bots to the designated home vertex. A set of one-hundred scouts are given to locate the bots. Each scout called on a given vertex returns true if they believe a bot is present. However, each scout provides false information on some unknown subset of the vertices. Two functions are provided to interact with the graph: 
### Scout(v):
